Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are hotspots for productivity and biodiversity. Thermal pyrolysis and circulation produce fluids rich in hydrocarbons and reduced compounds that stimulate microbial activity in surrounding sediments. Studies have characterized the diversity of Guaymas Basin (Gulf of California) sediment-inhabiting microorganisms, and many taxa were distinct from those whose physiologies have been described. Here, we resolved the metabolic potential and community-level interactions of these diverse communities. Therefore, we performed metagenomic sequencing of Guaymas Basin sediment samples and further reconstructed microbial genomes from the generated sequencing data.

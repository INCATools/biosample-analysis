In order to reveal the protective response law and mechanism induced by the ISKNV FKC vaccine, we also conducted a systematic transcriptomics analysis on sea bass. The result showed that immunized sea bass could induce high protective immune responses by activating T cell differentiation with the participation of a large number of hematopoietic cell proliferation differentiation genes and inflammatory factors. At various time points in the vaccinated group of sea bass, T cell activation GO terms were significantly enriched, and T cell response played a key role in the process of inhibiting virus invasion, which was the molecular basis for the formation of highly effective immune effects of the ISKNV FKC vaccine.

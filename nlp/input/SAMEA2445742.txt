“Draft Genome Sequence of 24570, the Type Strain of Shigella flexneri” . Pubmed ID 26021915. Shigella flexneri is a diarrheal pathogen that causes a large disease burden worldwide. We sequenced the genome of the publicly available type strain (S. flexneri 2a strain 24570) of this bacterial species to increase its utility as a reference. We present genome assembly results and comparisons with other reference strains.

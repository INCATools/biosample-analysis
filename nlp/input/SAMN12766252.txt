Annotated assembly of the Pimephales promelas (fathead minnow) genome. The project goals were to improve genomic assembly completeness, contiguity and gene annotation. Assembly was facilitated by PacBio SMRT read genomic sequencing and the latest generation of assembly algorithms. Scaffolding was based on Hi-C and optical mapping. Gene annotation was facilitated by mapping RNA-seq reads from RNA collected from a wide range of tissues and developmental stages.

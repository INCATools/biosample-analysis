This project aims at defining the identity, genomic diversity and microbiological characteristics of Corynebacterium diphtheriae isolates from the Yemen outbreak. POLICY NOTICE: The National Center for Public Health Laboratories (NCPHL, Ministry of Public Health, Sanaa, Yemen), University Health Network (Toronto, Canada) and Institut Pasteur (Paris, France)  believe in the early sharing of pathogen genetic sequence data to support research and public health responses. On this occasion, the data relate to the outbreak of diphtheria in Yemen. These data may be downloaded, analyzed and used for these purposes. We have released these sequences prior to publication. Our analyses of these sequences is ongoing and a publication is in preparation. It is not permitted to use the sequences for publication and any type of communication with the general public that describes data generated with the use of the sequences. If you intend to so, you must obtain our permission and coordinate with the authors of the sequence data release.

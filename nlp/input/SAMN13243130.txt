The purpose of this study was to identify endophytic bacteria from wild mushrooms in a park near Rochester, NY, USA. Wild mushrooms were homogenized, and bacteria from the homogenate were isolated on agar plates. Single colonies were subcultured, and genomic DNA from single colonies was extracted and subjected to library preparation and whole-genome sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq.

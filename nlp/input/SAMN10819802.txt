Accurate reconstruction of complete bacterial genomes, including plasmids and chromosomes, is a prerequisite to understanding the evolution and transmission of important antimicrobial resistance elements, particularly amongst Enterobacteriaceae. This study evaluated the accuracy of hybrid assembly approaches, using the most widely available long- and short-read sequencing methods (Pacbio/Illumina or Nanopore/Illumina), for reconstructing the genomes of several clinically relevant genera of Enterobacteriaceae.

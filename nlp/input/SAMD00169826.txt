The NBRC Whole Genome sequencing Project aims to provide "reference genomes" of NBRC culture collection strains for identifying useful genes for taxonomic classification, risk/safety assessment, and industrial application, and for understanding the structure and evolution of microbial genomes. One of our goals is to sequence 2,000 representative strains in the NBRC culture collection. The sequence information will be released to the society through the NBRC web site (http://www.nite.go.jp/en/nbrc/genome/index.html) and DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases.

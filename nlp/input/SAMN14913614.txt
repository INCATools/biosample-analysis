A necessary step in the understanding a function of gut microbiota is to obtain gut anaerobes in pure cultures, sequence them completely, predict their characteristic features and use them in all downstream experiments. In this study we therefore cultured and sequenced isolates from chicken caecum among which we identified isolates belonging to 6 different phyla including Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Elusimicrobia and Synergistetes.

The primary goal of the study was to enrich for siderophore producing microbes in 'Concord' grape vineyards by using various cover crops (barley, rye, wheat, or wheat/vetch). Soils were sampled from the vineyards and then further enriched for siderophore producing microbes in a novel microplate method, prior to next-generation sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). Ultimately, 10 whole genomes of siderophore producing microbes were sequenced, annotated, and compared through phylogenetics and comparative genomics.

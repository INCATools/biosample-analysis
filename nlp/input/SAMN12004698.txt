Salmonella enterica (non-Typhi) is one of the most common food-borne pathogens, primarily originating in agricultural animals, which can enter the food chain and cause salmonellosis in humans. Importantly a small number of serovars of Salmonella are responsible for the majority of cases of human salmonellosis. Salmonella enterica serovars typically exhibit a limited range of animal hosts, often referred to as serovar-host specificity. Swine, cattle, and poultry each carry different strains of Salmonella and only certain strains cause infectious disease in these hosts, with the remaining strains carried in a subclinical status or in a commensal relationship. In recent years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported a rise in human foodborne illnesses related to antibiotic resistant Salmonella enterica serovar I 4,[5], 12:i:- largely associated with the consumption of contaminated pork. Salmonella I 4,[5], 12:i:- is a serovar antigenically similar to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; however, it lacks the phase two flagellar antigen making it a monophasic variant.

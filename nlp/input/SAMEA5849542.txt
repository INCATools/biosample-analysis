Comprehensive reference data is essential for accurate taxonomic and functional characterisation of the human gut microbiome. Here we present the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection, a resource combining 286,997 genomes representing 4,644 prokaryotic species from the human gut. These genomes contain over 625 million protein sequences used to generate the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Protein (UHGP) catalogue, a collection that more than doubles the number of gut protein clusters over the Integrated Gene Catalogue. We find that a large portion of the human gut microbiome remains to be fully explored, with over 70% of the UHGG species lacking cultured representatives, and 40% of the UHGP missing meaningful functional annotations. Intra-species genomic variation analyses revealed a large reservoir of accessory genes and single-nucleotide variants, many of which were specific to individual human populations. These freely available genomic resources should greatly facilitate investigations into the human gut microbiome.

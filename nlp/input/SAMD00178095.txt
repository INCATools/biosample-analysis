The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii has become a serious problem in medical settings all over the world. This study was designed to clarify the genetic and epidemiological properties of MDR A. baumannii strains isolated from hospitals in Myanmar. Thirty-eight MDR A. baumannii isolates obtained from different patients in hospitals in Myanmar were screened by the broth microdilution method. The whole genomes of the MDR isolates were sequenced by MiSeq (Illumina). Phylogenetic trees were constructed from single nucleotide polymorphism concatemers. Multilocus sequence types were deduced and drug resistance genes were identified.

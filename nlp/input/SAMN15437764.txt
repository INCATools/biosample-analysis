Italy reported an outbreak of NDM-producing CRE affecting seven hospitals in the northwestern area of Tuscany, with 350 cases reported between November 2018 and 23 May 2019. Between November 2018 and May 2019, seven Tuscan hospitals notified a total of 350 cases. Due to its size and the resulting change in the epidemiology of CRE, the reported outbreak is a significant event, despite previous endemicity of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenamase (KPC)-producing CRE in this geographic area.

The current reference genome is a composite haplotype in which 70% of its sequences originates from a single DNA donor. In order to better understand the full scope of missing sequences in the human populations, we analyzed and breakpoint-resolved recurrent non-reference unique insertions from 338 genomes. Here we provide 74 de novo assemblies generated from high coverage (~60x average) 10x Genomics whole genome linked-read datasets. Other genomes included in our study are either publicly available or are restricted to public access due to privacy and local regulations.

The human vagina is colonized by a complex community of microbes ("vaginal microbiome") that play a role in reproductive health. The primary objective of this study was to define the range of vaginal microbiota profiles common in non-pregnant Canadian women of reproductive age without specific vaginal health concerns, in relation to socio-demographic, behavioural and clinical characteristics.

This project aims to generate a high-quality genome assembly for the Arkansas darter (Etheostoma cragini) and to use this genome as a reference for resequencing individuals across this species' range and for population-level sequence capture experiments. Data from this project will inform conservation efforts for declining populations of this species and will also be used to evaluate genomic and subgenomic sequencing strategies for species in the diverse darter radiation.

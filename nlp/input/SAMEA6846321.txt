We described a potential hypervirulent K. pneumoniae strain belonging to ST1049, a rare MLST type, isolated from neck abscess. K. pneumoniae of ST1049 was previously reported to cause liver abscess and meningitis, and resulting in poor clinical outcomes. However, no genetic evidence was showed that this infrequent MLST type was a hypervirulent clone. Hence, we will characterize the strain based on genetic background and virulence profile and thus to refresh our knowledge about hvKP pathogenicity.

New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-producing multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae is a critical threat to global health. K. pneumoniae S01 is a NDM-producing MDR strain and was used for systems pharmacology study on antimicrobial resistance. However, the lack of a complete genome sequence is a hindrance towards detailed bioinformatic studies. We thus aim to obtain the complete genome sequence of this strain by combining Illumina short reads and PacBio long reads.

We investigated the microbial communities present in a pilot-scale advanced water treatment facility for potable reuse. Samples were taken before treatment and after each treatment process to assess the changes in microbial communities throughout the facility. Samples were also taken from three simulated distribution systems receiving the treated water after chlorination and storage.

Saliva of blood sucking arthropods contains a complex mixture of bioactive polypeptides that disarm their hosts blood coagulation, platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction. We here run barcoded cDNA libraries from the salivary glands of adult female Lutzomyia umbratilis sand flies from two populations separated by the Amazon river. Sequences were assembled using Abyss and SoapdenovoTrans with several k values and the resulting contigs were further assembled by blast and cap3 iterations.

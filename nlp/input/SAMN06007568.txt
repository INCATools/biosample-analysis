WGS was performed on Burkholderia pseudomallei isolates associated with the Western Hemisphere. The goals are to determine phylogenetic relatedness among strains and to improve molecular analysis and subtyping for better epidemiological attribution to enhance public health responses. The relevance is to improve the ability to recognize and respond to cases of melioidosis in the Western Hemisphere since we believe the disease is underreported in this hemisphere.

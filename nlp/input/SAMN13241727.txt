The virulence phenotype (clinical strain, environmental strain) of Vibrio vulnificus was correlated with genotype, and the virulence gene was selected to further reveal the high risk factors of Vibrio vulnificus.Vibrio vulnificus is a Gram-negative halophilic bacterium commonly found in warm coastal waters. Although infections are rare, V. vulnificus is responsible for the most deaths caused by Vibrios and has the highest per case economic impact of all food-related diseases in the United States.

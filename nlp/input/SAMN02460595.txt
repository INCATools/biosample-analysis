The first version of this genome assembly, WGS project JSUE01000000, assembly GCA_000772875.1 was created by the Zimin and Norgren labs. This version used an alternate naming system for the rhesus macaque chromosomes. NCBI follows the conventional system of naming the rhesus macaque autosomes in order of decreasing size. A table  displays an alternate system of naming rhesus macaque chromosomes and the homologies between human, great ape, and rhesus macaque chromosomes.
The second version of this genome assembly was created by BCM-HGSC, in collaboration with Drs. Zimin and Norgren. This version uses the conventional system of naming chromosomes by decreasing size.

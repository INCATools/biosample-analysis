The increasing availability of C. botulinum genome sequences is now allowing the genomic diversity of C. botulinum Groups I, II, III, IV and botulinum toxin-containing Clostridia such as Clostridium butyricum to be characterised. This information will impact on microbiological food safety through improved surveillance and tracing/tracking during outbreaks, including the risk presented, and new insights into their biology, food chain transmission, and evolution.

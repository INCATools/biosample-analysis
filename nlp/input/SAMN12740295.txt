Enteric fever is a major public health problem in developing countries and the travellers returning from the endemic regions in developed world. Emergence of antimicrobial resistance in S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A, the two main causative organisms, continues to pose challenges in the treatment of this systemic infection. The appearance of resistant strains has necessitated the examination of the molecular basis of resistance to existing drugs in order to devise alternative therapeutic targets or strategies for the treatment of multidrug resistant bacterial infections. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) approach was used to predict known antimicrobial resistance genes and afterwards correlation between resistance genotypes with susceptibility phenotypes of chloramphenicol, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone (by disk diffusion method) was performed to evaluate WGS method for antimicrobial resistance surveillance.

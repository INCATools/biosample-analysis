It is most likely that the soil of the former lake Texcoco harbors much more novel microbial species with unique characteristics. However, the extent to which new microbial species can be found in this environment has not been determined. In this project, archaeal-specific primers were used combined with 454 pyrosequencing to investigate the archaeal diversity in soils from the former lake Texcoco

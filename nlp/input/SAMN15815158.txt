An open access human Gut Microbial Biobank (hGMB) were constructed by bacterial isolation and cultivation from feces of health volunteers. In total, 1176 isolates representing 404 different species from 159 genera, 53 families and 6 phyla were included in hGMB and deposited in International Depository Authority (IDA)- the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC) for long-term preservation and public use worldwide. The strain identities, genomic accessions and basic taxonomic information of known species were available in the webpage. Moreover, by genome sequencing and polyphasically characterization, 107 new species including 28 novel genera and 3 novel families were recognized by the hGMB work, and denominated following ICSP rules. Detailed genomic, taxonomic and biologic descriptions of the 108 new species were also provided in the webpage.

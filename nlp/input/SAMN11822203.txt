This project is an effort by the Pertussis and Diphtheria Laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study the genomic diversity of B. pertussis isolates collected in the United States. Isolates have been selected for sequencing with the intent to broadly sample representative phenotypes, genotypes, geographic locations, and disease severity. Comparative analyses of these data should shed new light on genome evolution while informing the development of novel molecular typing strategies for this important bacterial pathogen.

We used next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to identify mutations that arose during colonization by 246 S. aureus strains sequentially isolated from the cheek skin of 268 Japanese infants 1 month and 6 months after birth. Skin colonization with S. aureus at 6 months of age increased the risk for developing atopic dermatitis.

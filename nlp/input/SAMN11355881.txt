A total of 76 non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica (NTS) strains were isolated from the fecal material of on-farm chicken (n=29) and swine (n=47) that had the symptoms of Salmonella infection between Feb 2017 â€“ Jul 2017 in farms that are located in the Southeast region of Vietnam. All isolates were tested for phenotypic antibiotic resistance to 10 drugs from 6 antibiotic classes by broth microdilution method and were also subjected to whole genome sequencing. The AMR genes, serovar types, replicon sequences, genome and plasmid sequence types of these isolates were identified in their assembled genomes by ResFinder, SeqSero, PlasmidFinder and Multi-Locus Sequence Typing. This study aimed to compare the genetic diversity and AMR profiles of NTS that were isolated from the fecal material of swine and chicken in the Southeast region of Vietnam.

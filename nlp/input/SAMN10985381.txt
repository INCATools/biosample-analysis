A previous study has identified the variants blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-27, which are known to be widespread in bacteria from humans, among Escherichia coli isolates collected from Alberta feedlot cattle. We hypothesized that E. coli of human and beef cattle origins share the same pool of blaCTX-M genes. In this study, we aimed to assess and compare the genomic profiles of a larger collection of blaCTX-M-positive E. coli recovered from fecal composite samples from Canadian beef feedlot cattle and human wastewater through whole genome sequencing.

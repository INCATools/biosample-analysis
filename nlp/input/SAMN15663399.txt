Bacteria belonging to Pseudomonas putida (PpG) group, despite being present in different environments, are rarely involved in human infections. However, isolates belonging to this group can act as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance determinants, which can be transferred by mobile genetic elements (MGEs) to pathogens of animals and humans. The presence of multidrug-resistant strains (MDR) of PpG in the hospital environment has become increasingly frequent. However, most studies have been carried out in Europe and Asia, and little is known about its relevance in the current Brazilian scenario, especially with regard to the acquisition of resistance determinants. Recent findings, however, suggest that PpG isolates may acquire resistance determinants from other microorganisms, as well as contribute to their dissemination. Herein, we aimed to characterize the mechanisms of carbapenem resistance among PpG clinical isolates.

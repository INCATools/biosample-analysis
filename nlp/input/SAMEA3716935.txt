Here, we determined in a prospective manner over two intervals (each 6 month) the genome sequences of all major multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens detected at our University Hospital Muenster, Germany. Overall, several hundred bacterial genomes were successfully sequenced to elucidate their molecular epidemiology.

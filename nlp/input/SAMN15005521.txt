Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) biomineralize intracellular, membrane-bounded crystals of magnetite (Fe3O4) and/or greigite (Fe3S4) called magnetosomes. MTB play important roles in the geochemical cycling of Fe, S, N and C. They represent an intriguing model system not just for the study of microbial biomineralization but also for magnetotaxis (also known as magnetoreception), prokaryotic organelle formation and microbial biogeography. The goal of this project is to investigate the genomic diversity, ecology, biogeography and ecophysiology of MTB through metagenomics and/or single-cell genomics. Results of this project will provide novel insight into the origin, evolution, mechanism and environmental function of magnetotaxis and microbial biomineralization.

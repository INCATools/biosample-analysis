Deep-sea hydrothermal vents are characterized as one of most productive ecosystems on Earth, that supported by highly diversified uncultured microorganisms. Although microbial diversity has been extensively reported in active and inactive sulfide chimneys, less is known about the specific roles of uncultured microorganisms played in chimneys with different activities and the microbial succession for a newly formed chimney grow to mature and extinct finally. Here, we apply metagenomics to two sulfide chimneys with distinct activities from the Ease Pacific Rise hydrothermal filed, in which the L-vent is actively venting and the M-vent is weakly active.

We assessed the diversity of a beetle community sample using phylogenetic analyses of partial and complete mitochondrial genomes. gDNA extracts were pooled for sequencing without tagging or mitochondrial enrichment, followed by WGS sequencing of the pool with Illumina MiSeq. Mitochondrial genome sequences were assembled de novo from the resulting data and processed for phylogenetic analysis using a novel bioinformatic pipeline.

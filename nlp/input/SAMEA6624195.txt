We examined phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance, as well as the clonal relationship of commensal E. coli isolated on selective agar from fecal samples of young children and domestic animal feces present in the childâ€™s environment. We analyzed isolates (N = 264 selectively plated E. coli) from 21 children, 20 dogs, and 18 chickens. A pairwise single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analysis of the E. coli core genomes allowed us to detect 16 clonal complexes (CCs), defined as isolates with less than 100 different SNPs in the core genome. We observed that isolates belonging to the same CCs had acquired different antimicrobial resistance genes. Isolates from children and domestic animals shared the same blaCTX-M gene variants. Many of the CCs found were from children and animals present in the same home (n = 2), but several CCs were from different homes (n = 4), suggesting that community dissemination is occurring. This study provides strong evidence of the environmental transmission of antimicrobial resistant bacteria and AMR genes between domestic animals and children.

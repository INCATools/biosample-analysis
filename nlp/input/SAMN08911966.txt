Metagenomes and assembled genomes binned from metagenomes for 60 soil samples across multiple soil plots from a meadow in the Angelo Coastal Range Reserve, CA. This location is part of an on-going climate change experiment where some meadow plots have received additional rainfall via a sprinkler system since 2001. Soil samples were taken and sequenced from three depths (10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, and 30-40 cm) and from plots that have both received additional rainfall and control plots that have received ambient rainfall.

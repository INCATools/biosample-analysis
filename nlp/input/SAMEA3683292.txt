Study to support development of molecular epidemiology applications for Campylobacter coli by using genome sequencing. Study is funded by the UK Food Standards Agency, with isolates from collections of the Universities of Liverpool, Swansea, Nottingham and Bristol, and Public Health England. Sequencing was performed at The Genome Analysis Centre, Norwich, with support from the University of East Anglia. The study has been coordinated by the Institute of Food Research, Norwich, UK.  Aims: 1) TO DETERMINE THE GENOME SEQUENCE OF CAMPYLOBACTER COLI ISOLATES FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES: animal, food, water and environmental, and clinical laboratories. 2) TO DEFINE THE GENETIC VARIATION WITHIN THE CORE AND ACCESSORY REGIONS OF THE GENOME AS DEFINED BY THE SELECTED SERIES OF CAMPYLOBACTER COLI ISOLATES AND BY COMPARISON WITH C. JEJUNI DATA. 3) TO COMPARE THE NEWLY GENERATED CAMPYLOBACTER COLI GENOMIC INFORMATION WITH EXISTING TYPING METHODS 4) TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF A TYPING SCHEME SPECIFIC FOR CAMPYLOBACTER COLI USING THE INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE GENOMES

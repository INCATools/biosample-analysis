Pseudoalteromonas sp. Strain A25 is a gram negative, rod-shaped and pigmented (yellow) marine gamma-proteobacterium that was isolated from seawater of Ariake Sea. This strain exhibits strong algicidal activity against diatoms. In this study, we sequenced Pseudoalteromonas sp. strain A25 and its algicidal activity lacking mutant strain A25W1 to facilitate research on algicidal compounds for harmful algal species.

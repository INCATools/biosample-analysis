From July to November 2013  more than one hundred human cases of salmonellosis by Salmonella Typhimurium Monophasic variant were diagnosed in Piacenza and linked to pork-meat consumption. Epidemiological studies indicated that pork meat from a local producer was the main cause of the outbreak, while other producer/ pork breeders might have been implicated. PFGE typing detected that all human and the majority of food isolates belonged to the STYMXB.0131 genotype. To highlight the true epidemiological dynamic of this outbreak,a selection of human and food isolates associated with the Outbreak were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq sequencer with a 2x250 pair-end run. Library preparation was performed using Illumina Nextera XT kits.

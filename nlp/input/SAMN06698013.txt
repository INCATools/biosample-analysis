Population dynamics of S. aureus in Cystic Fibrosis patients to determine transmission events utilizing WGS. This study uses whole genome sequencing (WGS) to determine strain relatedness and assess population dynamics of Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a cohort of CF patients as assessed by strain relatedness. 311 S. aureus isolates were collected from respiratory cultures of 115 CF patients during a 22 month study period.

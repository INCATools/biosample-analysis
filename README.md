# Biosample analysis

Repo for analysis of biosamples in INSDC

Questions to explore

 - which attributes/properties are used
 - are these conformant to standards?
    - E.g. are MIxS fields used
    - Does the range constraint aapply?
 - Can we mine ontology terms, e.g. ENVO from text descriptions
 - can we auto-populate metadata fields
